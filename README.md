# Energy-Consumption
The demand for cost-effective energy and resource management continues to grow. There is a need for intelligent automated building solutions to decrease energy consumption which increases alternative energy sources, lessen operational costs, and find interoperable solutions that integrate with legacy equipment without huge investments. The ability to interpret, understand and predict building behavior offers enormous opportunities to demonstrate and confirm increased energy efficiencies, which may ease many extreme pressures taxing the Grid. In today's world, the ability to predict the household energy consumption can not only save money for the customer but can also help in generating money for them by giving back excess energy to Grid. Implemented Gradient Boosting, Extra Tree Regressor, Random forest, Support Vector Machine, Multivariate Adaptive splines, Ridge, Lasso, Elastic NetRegularization, Partial Least Squares Regression, KNN, and Decision Tree. Data used include measurements of temperature and humidity sensors from a wireless network, weather from a nearby airport station, and recorded energy use of lighting fixtures
